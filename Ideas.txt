Variables
---------

INPUT

n = number of slits (2 or d.g.) -> expand to faithfully calculate for n sources later on
d = slit spacing

wavelength1
wavelength2

screen shape, size

OUTPUT

path difference between adjacent slits
interference condition (brightness)
angular positions of bright and dark spots

Structures
-------------

Diff. pattern as object
->array of angular positions
-> colours present
-> additive colour

Experiment as object
->grating
->wavelength
->DiffPattern
->Screen

Screen as object
->shape
->distance
->illumination?
