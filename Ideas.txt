Ideas

Variables
---------

INPUT

n = number of slits (2 or d.g.) -> expand to faithfully calculate for n sources later on
d = slit spacing

wavelength1
wavelength2

screen shape, size

OUTPUT

path difference between adjacent slits
interference condition (brightness)
angular positions of bright and dark spots

Structures
-------------

Diff. pattern as object
->array of angular positions
-> colours present
-> additive colour

Experiment as object
->grating
->wavelength
->DiffPattern
->Screen

Screen as object
->shape
->distance
->illumination?

Interface
---------
overall...
-"Toylike": mess with variables and see what happens - numbers are available on request
-"Check": scenario is presented, user guesses/calculates response, overlaid on situation
	- e.g. "angular position of 3rd-order maximum under THESE circumstances

elements...
-user-draggable screen position

switches
-circular and flat screen
-YDS or DG

buttons
-'add' colour/wavelength (within range UV - IR)

sliders
-colour selector (spectral & wavelength)
-spacing (d & lines per mm)
